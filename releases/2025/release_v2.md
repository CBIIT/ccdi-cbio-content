## Version v1.1.0
### September 2025 
With the latest release, we have expanded the data available in the Molecular Characterization Initiative dataset. Additions include copy number data for 3,607 participants, more clinical data properties (MGMT Methylation Status, Methylation Diagnosis Subclass, Sample Percent Necrosis, Sample Percent Tumor, Treatment Response, and Treatment Agent), and Reported Significance annotation on the mutation data. See the [Dataset Updates](dataset-updates) section for more information on these data. 

We have also addressed seven newly identified vulnerabilities. In addition, we made several improvements to the siteâ€™s design and usability, including updates to responsive styles to enhance the mobile experience, refreshed footer links, and other adjustments to the header and footer. We also improved the readability and overall presentation of the About page.
