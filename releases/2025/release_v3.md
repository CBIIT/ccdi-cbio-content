## Version v1.2.0
### December 2025 
With the latest release, we have added two new datasets. In addition, we have updated the Molecular Characterization Initiative dataset to include structural variant data and remove some ineligible participants. Additionally, where available, we have added links from the CCDI cBioPortal participants to the CCDI Hub. See the [Dataset Updates](dataset-updates) section for more information on these data.

We have also addressed some newly identified security vulnerabilities and updated the backend monitoring and tracking capabilities. We added a new page to the application to instruct users on how to cite and use the CCDI cBioPortal data as well.
