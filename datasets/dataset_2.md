## Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) Project v15
The Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) v15 data was [downloaded directly](https://kf-strides-cbioportal-studies-public.s3.amazonaws.com/public/openpedcan_v15.tar.gz) from the [Peds cBioPortal](https://pedcbioportal.kidsfirstdrc.org/datasets) instance. The existing participant-level data was then supplemented with links to the same participants in the [CCDI Hub](https://ccdi.cancer.gov/explore). To learn more about how the dataset was prepared, please refer to this [publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40891528/) and this [documentation](https://github.com/d3b-center/OpenPedCan-analysis).
